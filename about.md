## Who am I?

My name is Yasin Ã–zel and I am living in Istanbul. Let me tell my story; my father was an electrical technician, so breaking something into parts, fixing and "hacking" things are part of our daily life. As a result, technology has always caught my attention since my childhood. This interest led me to computer programming, and currently I am a Python developer.

## What is this blog about?

I am aiming two things with this blog. One is sharing knowledge. And other and the most important one is improve my english. My english is not good and I decided to make something for change this. Writing a blog in english will improve my english, i think. Also, if you find a grammatical error in my blog, don't hestitate to get in contact with me (me[at]yozel[dot]co).
